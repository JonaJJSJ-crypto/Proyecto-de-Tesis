Here will be the simulation:

This simulations has one lw term mixing for electrons in the lagrangian using FeynRules.
 
 1.Using the eigen vector from the Mixing matrix proposed by Alvares et.al. I have chosen the mixing terms only containing the Doublet lw partner with the Doublet electron
 2.In the File SM.fr there has been defined the lwZ boson partner and the lwe partner for electron. 
 3.The lagrangian term consist of mixing described in Alvarez et.al. B1 and Table.II
 4. There been calculated the Feyman Rules for this Model Using ("WriteUFO[LSM, AddDecays -> True, Output -> "LWSMv2"]")
 
 Insert LWSM folder int he models folder in Feynrules for proper calculations
